“Something Beautiful to Enjoy While Listening to Music”

What your assignment does:
My assignment plays a song I have chosen which is Neon Trees ft Kaskade – Lessons in Love and uses 
some shapes to go with the music and react to it while it’s playing and I also made a background 
from triangles to add to the aesthetic. 

What the controls are:
There are no controls you just run the code and it does everything itself. 

How to make it run:
All you have to do is run the code and it will do the magic of coding itself. 

A list of the stuff you are most proud of:
I’m most proud of getting the shapes to go exactly where I wanted them to go to fir perfectly with 
one another also having the shapes react to the music enough that you can see very decisively when 
the bass kicks in and really makes the visualiser go mad which is very cool to watch. 

What each team member did:
I was in a group on my own so I added in all the extra code myself and worked out where each point 
for the triangles would go and same for the circles and the colours of each
